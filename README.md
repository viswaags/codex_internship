## 🧠 Projects Overview

### 1. **House Price Prediction**
- A machine learning project that predicts house prices using linear regression.
- Uses a dataset (`housing.csv`) and includes model evaluation.
- 📂 [`house_price_prediction/`](./house_price_prediction)

### 2. **Matrix Operations**
- A web-based tool for performing matrix operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.
- Built using `Gradio` for an interactive interface.
- 📂 [`matrix_operations/`](./matrix_operations)

### 3. **Sentiment Analysis Web App**
- A web application to analyze the sentiment of a given text.
- Outputs sentiment class, polarity, and subjectivity.
- Built with Flask, includes frontend and styling.
- 📂 [`sentiment_analysis/`](./sentiment_analysis)
